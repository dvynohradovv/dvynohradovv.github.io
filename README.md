# > Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive terminal portfolio. This project, built with Astro, mimics a command-line interface where you can explore my skills, projects, and more. Type `help` to get started and see a list of available commands.

## About Me

Full-Stack Software Engineer specializing in the development of complex and mission-critical systems. My current work involves building the core platform that powers the law-making process for U.S. state governments, where I am responsible for the full technology stack: from backend services in Python (Django, GraphQL) to user-facing web applications in React and specialized C#/.NET plug-ins for Microsoft Office.

My experience spans diverse domains, from fintech, where I've built systems for automating financial data processing, to b2b compliance platforms. Regardless of the product, I believe that robust systems are built on a solid foundation: clean, maintainable code (SOLID), a fully automated path to production (CI/CD, Docker), and a pragmatic approach to data management, using the right tool for the job (PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Redis).

I am convinced that the best products are created by strong, collaborative teams. I actively contribute to this by participating in code reviews, sharing knowledge, and mentoring junior colleagues, understanding that the team's collective growth is the best way to improve the final product. I am looking for an opportunity to apply my skills to solve challenging technical problems in an environment that values engineering excellence.

## Technology Stack

This project is built with modern web technologies, including:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**: The web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: For type-safe code.
